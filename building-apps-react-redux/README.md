# Starter Kit for [Building Applications in React and Redux](http://www.pluralsight.com/author/cory-house) on Pluralsight

## Get Started

1. **Install [Node 8](https://nodejs.org)** or newer. Need to run multiple versions of Node? Use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)(https://github.com/coryhouse/pluralsight-redux-starter/archive/master.zip)
2. **Navigate to this project's root directory on the command line.**
3. **Install Node Packages.** - `npm install`
4. **Install [React developer tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en) and [Redux Dev Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en)** in Chrome.
5. Having issues? See below.

## Having Issues? Try these things first:

1. Run `npm install` - If you forget to do this, you'll get an error when you try to start the app later.
2. Don't run the project from a symbolic link. It will cause issues with file watches.
3. Delete any .eslintrc in your user directory and disable any ESLint plugin / custom rules within your editor since these will conflict with the ESLint rules defined in the course.
4. On Windows? Open your console as an administrator. This will assure the console has the necessary rights to perform installs.
5. Ensure you do not have NODE_ENV=production in your env variables as it will not install the devDependencies. To check run this on the command line: `set NODE_ENV`. If it comes back as production, you need to clear this env variable.
6. Nothing above work? Delete your node_modules folder and re-run npm install.

# 03-notes

Webpack is configured via a JavaScript object, and typically the config file is called webpack.config.js, and it's placed in the project root.

use the CommonJS syntax here since we're working in Node.Node still lacks support for ES modules,

```
   "babel":{
     "preset":[
       "babel=preset-react-app"
     ]

 }
}
```

Babel can be configured via a .babelrc file, but I prefer configuring it via package.json.

This single preset will tell Babel to transpile our JSX, and it will also allow us to safely use a long list of modern JavaScript features, including object spread, class properties, dynamic imports, and much more.

Now, this is the same Babel preset that's used by create‑react‑app, so you can dig into their preset if you're curious about all the details on how this configures Babel. In short, just understand that this one preset means that we can use modern JavaScript and a number of experimental features too, but our code will run in all recent browsers because Babel will convert it into a form that all recent browsers can understand.

```
"start": "webpack-dev-server --config webpack.config.dev.js --port 3000"
```

This key that we declare will determine how we call it on the command line. What we want to call is webpack‑dev‑server, and we're going to tell it where to find our configuration, which is the webpack.config.dev.js that we created in a previous clip. Finally, I'm going to configure it to run on port 3000.

```
  "eslintConfig": {
    "extends": [
      "eslint:recommended",
      "plugin:react/recommended",
      "plugin:import/errors",
      "plugin:import/warnings"
    ],
```

this enables many recommended rules

```
    "parser": "babel-eslint",
    "parserOptions": {
      "ecmaVersion": 2018,
      "sourceType": "module",
      "ecmaFeatures": {
        "jsx": true
      }
    },
```

```
    "env": {
      "browser": true,
      "node": true,
      "es6": true,
      "jest": true
    },
```

```
    "rules": {
      "no-debugger": "off",
      "no-console": "off",
      "no-unused-vars": "warn",
      "react/prop-types": "warn"
    },
```

```
    "settings": {
      "react": {
        "version": "detect"
      }
    },
    "root": true
  }
}
```
